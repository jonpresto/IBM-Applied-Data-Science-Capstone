# IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone

This was a guided project developed by IBM.  The models aims to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each.  Much of the savings is due to SpaceX reusability at the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Knowing the cost can be useful if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
